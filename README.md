About Cargo:

- We can create a project using cargo new.
- We can build a project using cargo build.
- We can build and run a project in one step using cargo run.
- We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check.
- Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.
